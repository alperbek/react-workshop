* Flux
- open sourced by Facebook
- not a library, a technique like MVC
- suitable for bigger applications

* When is Flux a good idea?

- Too deep level in React hiearchy
- Need to pass props to the bottom too much
- Two components not having a single parent, but want to sync state


* Stores
- Enclose the domain logic
- Act as event emitters
- Emits a change event whenever it changes
- Simple version, not Flux: No actions
- React component intercepts the events, forwards them to store
- React component subscribe to store events
- React component syncs its state with store

* Actions
- As apps get big, react component should not call store directly
- Instead a level of indirection
- React components intercept events
- Forward them to dispatcher as events

* Dispatcher
- Dispatcher broadcasts events to all stores
- Stores decide which events they are interested in
- They decide accordingly and emit a change event
- React components sync accordingly
